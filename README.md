Notification Microservice 
(currently for push notifications)

A robust, asynchronous, and priority-aware push notification service built using **Spring Boot**, **Redis Streams**, and **Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM)**. This system ensures reliable delivery with support for retry mechanisms, scheduled notifications, and smart failure handling ‚Äî designed for scalability and production-readiness.

## üöÄ Features

- üîî **Priority-Based Notification Handling**  
  Sends notifications with `HIGH`, `MEDIUM`, and `LOW` priority levels, each mapped to configurable Time-To-Live (TTL) durations.

- üîÅ **Retry Mechanism with Exponential Backoff**  
  Retries failed notifications up to a configurable limit using exponential delay to avoid spamming and ensure effective delivery.
Triggers the mechanism for atmost 3 retries.

- üóìÔ∏è **Scheduled Notifications**  
  Supports future-dated delivery by storing requests in the database and periodically dispatching them through a scheduler.
Currently scheduled after every 60 seconds/

- ‚öôÔ∏è **System ,API and Event-Triggered Events**  
  Accommodates both programmatically generated (event) and externally triggered (API-based and system) notifications.
For Event triggered notification different events can be programatically added to trigger the notification.
For system notifications api can be integrated for each system triggered event .

- üì≤ **Multi-Platform Delivery via FCM**  
  Sends notifications to Android apps and web clients using Firebase Cloud Messaging.

- üß† **Smart Failure Detection**  
  Maintains delivery status and retry attempts in the database for post-analysis, visibility, and reliability improvements.

- üß† **Handless Invalid FCM token**
   If notifications fails due to invalid fcm token than that token is deleted from the device table and waits for new token .
